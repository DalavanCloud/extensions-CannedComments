This extension adds the ability for users to store 'canned' or saved
comments for reuse without having to retype them each time. The UI 
is displayed below the comment textarea on show_bug.cgi. Using the UI
the user can designate a current comment as a new canned comment. Also
the user can select a previous canned comment and it will be automatically
inserted into the comment textarea if the user has javascript enabled.
Without javascript it can still be used as the comment will be added
on the backend.
